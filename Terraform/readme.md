⇴ As per my understanding:

Terraform is an IaC software that is multi-cloud (well it covers more than that), terraform is a API Connector i.e it gives you an way to write a structured code which will be used to create resources using the vendor specific API. it also manages a state (i.e a table of resources it has created) so that it can be used delete/destroy/clean after the process. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro" target="_blank"> read more here.⤤ </a>

### My Personal Experience

<figure>
Necessity is the Mother of All Inventions

Till the time you do not explore the software or solution yourself, you will not know or not understand the importance of it.
When i first heard IaC it was very difficult for me to understand or explain it to someone what it is. i can only memorized without knowning what, where and how it works.
The moment i started practically learning AWS (using ACloudGuru Cloud-Sanboxes) i understood that after creating the same VPC-Subnet-RT-IGW-EC2 it was time consuming, since i was not able to proceed (ACloudGuru Cloud-Sanboxes has max 4 Hours Access) ahead and do any new thing. i thought of automating it, using CLI, AWS CloudFormation.
But after some research i can accross Terraform and the story continues.

Terraform is amazing, it helped me understand why would someone want a IaC, how to actually create one template and learn AWS better.
